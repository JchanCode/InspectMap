# NYC Restaurant violations

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene performs unannounced sanitary inspections of every restaurant at least once per year. Violation points result in a letter grade along with violation descriptions.

I want to create a front end for that database allowing users to access those information seamlessly.

# Post Covid Restaurant Menus
